/** JOURNAL-001 - I kinda like Celia to be honest
 * We are in: October 29, 2022 @ 133 CST (NO-DST)
 *
 * And I dont mean in the sexual, overly perverted way either. I just genuinely like her.
 * She's just really smart and creative in every way. We sometimes spend time together
 * doing late night coding...sometimes just for the fun of it too! I dont know because I've
 * never had this feeling before. When I'm with her I just feel calm...it's almost as if time
 * completely stops. That's a good and bad thing though! When I talk with her sometimes
 * we go in depth with topics and it gets so interesting I almost miss my appointments.
 *
 * She thought me to comment my code by the way...haha
 * Before I used to leave my code uncommented. I'm forever grateful for that though.
 *
 * It's fun to be around her though. I really like her.
 *
 * __"When in doubt, code it out!"__
