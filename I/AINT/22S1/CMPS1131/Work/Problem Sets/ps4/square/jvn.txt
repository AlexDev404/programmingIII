/** JOURNAL-000 - Yes, we're writing a journal now
 * We are in: October 29, 2022 @ 0125 MST (NO-DST)
 * 
 * Coding solo because Alex has just kicked me out of the programming group
 * I really hate what he did to Alfred because he has been very manipulative towards him
 * He has tried to do the same with me from the first time we met but I instead rejected it
 * One of the reasons he hates me, quite honestly.
 * 
 * It's really hard to code or even focus because of all the crap that has been happenening 
 * with him
 * 
 * Alfred is my friend though, and I just cannot lay back and watch this happen to him
 * I will do everything I can to set him free
 * 
 * __"There is an air of mystery currently present..."__
