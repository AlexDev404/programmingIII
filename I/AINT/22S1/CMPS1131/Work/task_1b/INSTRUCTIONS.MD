1. Create a project called functions. Design and implement the functions 
   below in the *main.cpp* file
    

A. Write a function called greeting() that outputs *Hello there!* when
   called. You are to call this function from the main function.


B.  Write a function called sumNumbers() that when called asks the user for 2
    integers. These integers are added and the result is outputted to the
    console. You are to call this function from the main function.


C. Write a function called getAreaOfSquare(double side) that accepts
   one parameter, the length of a side of a square. The getAreaOfSquare
   function should then calculate and output the area of the square.
   You are to call this function from the main function.

D. Write a function called getLastDigit(int age) that accepts
   one parameter, an integer that represent a personâ€™s age. 
   The getLastDigit function should then return the last digit
   in the person's age. You are to call this function from the main function.
 
 
E. Write a function called getAreaOfRect(double length, double width) 
   that accepts two parameters, the length and width of a rectangle. 
   The getAreaOfRect function should then calculate and return the area
   of the rectangle. You are to call this function from the main function.

F. Write a function called sumNumbers(int num1, int num2)
   that accepts two parameters which represents numbers that the
   user wants to add. The sumNumbers function should then calculate and return
   the sum of the two numbers. You are to call this function from
   the main function.
